# basebits

A library for memory efficient short DNA sequence encoding.

## Synopsis

When to use this library? 
If you are comparing strings against each other more than 4 times, it
becomes more efficient to pay the cost of encoding them. 

## Operations

Constant time hamming distance calculations

## Reference

## Future directions

FFT stuff?
